        I originally wrote alt text for nearly all of the media on this page. 
        But I decided later that the images are actually decorative, and so I used mostly empty alt attributes instead. 
        I suppose alt attribute judgement is a learned skill that will take practice!

                First and foremost: I am not a very good programmer; I'm taking courses to get there. The only language
                I'd currently say I'm proficient with is VB.NET because it was taught in the programming class I took in
                highschool. I know a good bit of web design (HTML/CSS) but VB.NET was the only thing I learned in-depth
                and continued using after I got out of highschool.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've actually learned a lot about programming since I graduated. I used the foundation of VB.NET to
                teach myself about the workings of hardware and software. There are a few projects I've made that I'm
                actually kind of proud of and I'd like to show off. They're not much but I think they're neat!

            <h2>Force Of Attraction</h2>
            <img class="standalone-media" height="360" src="images/foa-planetmoon.gif" alt="">
            <p>
                Force of Attraction is a crude 2d simulation of gravity between masses that was inspired by an online
                tool of a similar nature (that is now sadly inaccessible, so I can't link it.) I can manually hard-code
                a scenario but it can also generate a spinning disk of objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                The loop at play goes something like:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>calculate the force of gravity between each pair of objects</li>
                <li>calculate the change in each object's velocity based on the force</li>
                <li>check for collision of any of the objects with one another</li>
                <li>move all of the objects based on their velocity</li>
                <li>draw the objects on a bitmap and display it</li>
            </ol>
            <img class="standalone-media" height="360" src="images/foa-diskgen.gif" alt="">
            <p>
                VB.NET is obviously NOT meant for real-time graphics of any kind, but I try it from time to time anyway
                for funsies. I'm actually quite impressed that Drawing2D Graphics pulls off drawing a bitmap on a
                1920x1080 form at 20fps. That's mostly thanks to the fact that I've set the interpolation quality
                settings as low as they can go. (I honestly think the pixel effect it achieves is actually very pretty!)
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't have anything more to say about it. It's really just the manifestation of my physics obsession
                into a piece of pixelated eye candy!

            <p>
                This one is a web scraper to download media from Twitter. "Scraper" has a bad connotation, but it's what
                this technically qualifies as, even though it just downloads the <abbr title="high quality">HQ</abbr>
                media from singular tweets. If you don't know, Twitter stores images in multiple quality levels. The
                quality that gets retrieved is specified in the <abbr title="uniform resource locator">URL</abbr> that
                fetches them. I got tired of manually altering the media URL to get the "orig" version (best quality),
                so I made a tool to change the URL automatically.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:20px;text-indent:0px;">
                Then, I thought it'd be cool if it could download the media for me after fixing the links. <br>
                <i>Then,</i> I thought it'd be cool if it grabbed links from the clipboard when I copied them. <br>
                <span class="bi">Then,</span> I thought it'd be cool if it used the tweet status link to get the media
                links. <br>
                <span class="bi">THEN,</span> I thought it'd be cool if it saved the tweet text and metrics to a txt
                file.

            <p>
                ... So yeah, I started out with a simple enough app that modified a string input, and accidentally set
                out to make a supremely overengineered tweet scraper. Such is programming, I guess. I did a CRAP ton of
                in-depth string manipulation/optimization, learned how to use the Selenium web driver, and put my HTML
                knowledge to use when learning/configuring Xpaths (to help the driver find the elements it needs to.)
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't have a lot of experience making anything I'd consider "useful." But if anything I've made
                counts, it's probably this. I still use it on a regular basis, (and sometimes have to update the Xpaths
                whenever Twitter puts out an update to make their site worse. Bleh.)
            </p>

                For clarity's sake: this tool is exclusively for personal use. I have no intention to share it or use it
                for anything even close to malicious. (I'm not even skilled enough to make something remotely capable of
                any digital harm.) It's just a minor convenience tool for me.

            <p>
                NoiseImage is kind of like TwtDL where it started as something simple: an app that creates images that
                are just random noise. But it ended up with a number of cool features because I just kept adding what I
                felt like. As cool as it is, I think it falls just short of being "useful," and fits squarely into the
                "novel" category.
            </p>
            <div class="media-gallery">

                It can generate different types of random images, resize images, and my favorite thing: It can
                encode secret text messages into the color values of the image! This works by:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Converting text into an array of bytes (in either ASCII or UTF-8 encoding.)</li>
                <li>Converting the array of text bytes to binary (ones and zeros.)</li>
                <li>Converting a lossless image (PNG, BMP) to an array of color value bytes.</li>
                <li>Iterating through each color value (in BGR or RGB order, but images store values in BGR order so
                    that's the default), and adding or subtracting one to make it even or odd in correspondence to the
                    binary bit. (0 = even, 1 = odd.)</li>
                <li>Writing the modified color byte array back to the original image.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The process can be reversed to read the binary bit encoded in each color value, convert the
                            bits to bytes, and the bytes to a string of text.</li>
                        <li>The end of the message is signed with the EOT char, and the rest of the values' parities are
                            flipped at random to simulate slight noise on the image to hide the message.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

                I'm pretty sure that I'm not the one who invented this method of steganography, but I was never into
                steganography before I tried to do this, so I honestly have no idea if that's the case. I'm not even
                sure what inspired me to go about it in the first place. I had the idea one day while working on the
                NoiseImage app. I made a sort of cipher key image for the concept, and then had nothing better to do
                than go out and make it a thing!

                Developing this project taught me a good bit about image encoding, text encoding, reading binary,
                manipulating large byte arrays, and it also taught me a TON of optimizing techniques, especially with
                images and within loops. It used to take multiple seconds to encode/decode, or minutes if the string was
                lengthy. And now it can encode almost anything in a fraction of a second! Would you like to see the
                entirety of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" that I coded into the colors of this
                otherwise-seemingly-unassuming PNG in a tenth of a second? Of course you do!!!
