            <h1><s>What I'm learning about right now!</s></h1>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px">(what i was learning about in winter semester of 2024)</p>
            <p>
                It's my first semester taking classes at OCC, and my first time taking asynchronous online classes, so
                I'm still settling into the rhythm of it all. Adjusting to the format and workload has been a trip, but
                it's been fun. Even on the grind, I'm having a good time learning about stuff I think is neat!
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's a brief rundown of what I've learned and done in each of my classes:
            </p>
            <div class="table-container">
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Class</th>
                        <th>Material</th>
                        <th>Work</th>
                        <th>Thoughts</th>
                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td class="row-header">Composition</td>
                        <td>Essentially just English Language Arts, but it focuses on the writing portion.</td>
                        <td>I've written a Memoir about why I left my previous job to pursue school, a Rhetorical
                            Analysis on the Burger King "Whopper Whopper" commercial, and am just starting a Research
                            Paper on the importance of Media Literacy.</td>
                        <td>I've always felt like writing comes naturally to me, though I prefer to write on my own
                            terms about topics I'm passionate about. I'm thankful I've gotten to do so much of that for
                            this class.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="row-header">Intro to Databases</td>
                        <td>An overview of how databases work, how they are managed, and how people interact with them.
                        </td>
                        <td>This class is mostly just conceptual. I've done a lot of what you'd expect: reading up on
                            databases and discussing it with classmates. I've also done quite a few Microsoft Learn
                            modules and learned the basics of SQL, so that's another language under the belt.</td>
                        <td>I think the most interesting part about this class to me is getting a glimpse behind the
                            curtain of a lot of modern data infrastructure. It's a peek into the "black box" if you
                            will.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="row-header">Networking</td>
                        <td>About administrating a network's hardware and software, and the finer details of
                            inter-device communication.</td>
                        <td>Most of the work in this class is video and practice modules, with some focus questions and
                            class discussion every few chapters. BUT I've written two Research Assignments for this
                            class: one on Video-conferencing, and one on Subnetting.</td>
                        <td>This one is mega interesting. All of the things that you <i>think</i> you understand, but
                            when you look deeper, there's so much that's been abstracted away from network/internet
                            users to make it accessible, without requiring you to know <i>exactly</i> what's really
                            going on. So much blackboxing in modern technology. It's fascinating!</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="row-header">HTML5 Programming</td>
                        <td>This class is about not only HTML, but CSS and JavaScript too. (Which makes sense because
                            they all go hand-in-hand.)</td>
                        <td>Funny enough, this WHOLE WEBSITE is work for this class!</td>
                        <td>Like I mentioned, I took a web design course in highschool, so I actually know a lot of the
                            stuff covered! This is just a refresher and has been a much-welcome creative outlet and
                            deviation from the work I do in other classes.</td>
