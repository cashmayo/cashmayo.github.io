                <p>
                    This masterpiece was released in 2013,
                    following the critically acclaimed open world <abbr title="first person shooter">FPS</abbr>, Far Cry
                    3. It shares its title and almost all of its gameplay mechanics with Far Cry 3, but it has a new
                    story, a new open world, and a ton of new bad guys to take down! It takes place in the dystopian
                    future; in <span class="bi">2007</span>.

                <p>
                    I've always been a sucker for FPS titles and this one is no exception. I played this game during
                    the 2020 lockdowns while going through my list of things I told myself I'd play if I had infinite
                    time. First, I played FC3, then honestly expected FC3:BD to be an average DLC that was sold as a
                    new game just for an extra buck, but I was <i>wrong.</i> The game's epic vibe, fun gameplay, and
                    seeming self-awareness of its own humor and nonsense had me totally hooked. I loved just about
                    everything about this game, which is why I decided to give the speedrun a try.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The majority of the speedrun is (unfortunately) a good bit of running place to place and waiting for
                    autoscrollers (AKA setpieces with scripted timing) to finish. Which is par for the 'open world game'
                    course. However, most of the cutscenes are skippable, which I'm quite thankful for, since that's
                    pretty unusual for a Far Cry title. (Much like Blood Dragon as a whole!)
                </p>

                <p>
                    The part of the game that makes it worth running is the combat sections, because either: they
                    <strong>DO</strong> require the player to eliminate some (or all) of the enemies. So the player
                    must be proficient with combat tools, know the levels and the enemy positions/patterns, and adapt
                    quickly to any actions the enemy AI takes. OR: they <strong>DON'T</strong> require the player to
                    eliminate any enemies, and so create a type of challenge where the player has to safely and swiftly
                    navigate through dangerous arenas as fast as possible without getting caught up on the enemies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back when I started running the game midway through 2020, the Any% record was 45 minutes and 23
                    seconds, and development of the speedrun had essentially stagnated. But in the past few years since
                    I've started running the game, the FC3:BD speedrunning community has worked together (and Zaiydo and
                    myself have competed) to bring the record down to 41:03 (by Zaiydo)!

                <p>
                    I pre-ordered this game back in 2016, and knew it was special from the time I got it home and
                    played through it. (I actually knew it was special months before, during the pre-alpha playtests!)
                    It's a futuristic FPS with a focus on advanced movement abilities and mech-combat. Unlike its
                    predecessor, Titanfall (which was multiplayer only), Titanfall 2 includes a single-player story
                    that's full of uniquely designed levels and setpieces for all of the game's awesome mechanics.

                <p>
                    The game runs on Respawn Entertainment's modified branch of Valve Software's Source engine. If
                    you're familiar with the Source engine, you may know it as a quirky engine with a ton of tricks that
                    are utilized by the speedrunners of Valve Software games. That, combined with all of the incredibly
                    skill-rewarding parkour elements in Titanfall 2, makes for one of the most deep and skillful
                    movement based FPS speedruns to ever exist.
                </p>
                <img class="standalone-media" height="300" src="images/titanfall2speedrunmeme.gif" alt="">
                <p>
                    This game was actually the first game I ever speedran. (You can read the story of my discovery of
                    speedrunning <a href="speedruns-story.html">here</a>!) I got really good at the timed course in the
                    very first level of the game: The Gauntlet. I also did quite a bit of running the campaign, even
                    taking the world record once, but my main bread and butter has always been the Gauntlet. (If you
                    want to learn more about my campaign/gauntlet achievements, you can view my showcase
                    <a href="speedruns-showcase.html">here</a>!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    My position within the game's speedrunning community was distinctive. While most of the top runners
                    in the community played on keyboard and mouse, I played on controller as a result of being on
                    console for the first couple of years I speedran. I wouldn't say I am or ever was the "best"
                    controller player, but I was certainly willing to push myself without letting my atypical input
                    method discourage me. (I was <i>"built different"</i> as they say.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    –Until the later half of 2020, when some keyboard exclusive techniques started seeing extensive use
                    within the run. It was quite discouraging to see everyone discussing new routes and tech, while I
                    was doing my same old thing and being surpassed by the players I once loved competing against. For a
                    while, I tried implementing the keyboard tech into my own runs via controller mapping software
                    (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

                        href="https://youtu.be/FwttK3UXj40">which we voted to be legal!</a>) But the harder I tried to
                    match what could be done on a keyboard with my
                    controller, the further I strayed from playing the game I loved in the way I loved to play it...
                </p>
                <p>
                    I still do Gauntlet runs to this day, because it's the only part of the game where keyboard
                    exclusive tech isn't an advantage (yet?) and I still talk in the TF2SR discord server once in a blue
                    moon. I have all love and respect for the Titanfall 2 Speedrunning community. I just don't have it
                    in me to run the campaign anymore, but boy do I wish I did. What a blast it was!!!!!

                <p style="text-indent:48px;">
                    As well as the games I've given a shot and stuck with, there's a number of games I gave a shot and
                    <i>didn't</i> stick with. This will include a mention of each title with a <s>short</s> description
                    of
                    the game and what is good or bad about the speedrun. All of the games listed here are GREAT casual
                    experiences; otherwise I would never want to speedrun them. So definitely <u>no negative feelings
                        about any of these titles.</u> I just never kept at their speedrun for one reason or another.

                    I mentioned before that I'm a sucker for FPS titles. This is <span class="bi">not</span>
                    one of them, which might
                    be the primary reason it wasn't my jam. It's a cute game, and I adore it, but I never quite got the
                    hang of the speedrun. Most of the run is focused on precise movement with the shield sliding
                    mechanic to navigate the open world. I ran it for about a week, started about 100 runs, finished
                    just over a dozen runs, and submitted one or maybe two of them before I set it down. Fun game, and
                    honestly, great speedrun, it just never clicked with me very well.

                    made by a fellow speedrunner, Fzzy. It's inspired by Titanfall 2's movement, but really puts
                    focus on flow and precision as core gameplay elements. It consists of eight individual levels that
                    vary between 10-40 seconds long. It's here and not with the main titles because it's been a hot
                    minute since I played: It isn't being developed, it doesn't have much of a "community" to speak of,
                    and being a demo, it has some small bugs that irk me bigtime as a runner. But man did I love
                    grinding this game. It's totally epic mode, for real.

                    <a href="favorites.html#jdhugo">here</a>!) I actually have <i>quite</i> a bit more to say
                    about this one than the other mentions. The Jungledyret game is a 1995 <abbr
                        title="Disk Operating System">DOS</abbr> sidescroller that was made to promote the
                    second Jungledyret film that would release the following year. Modern operating systems no longer
                    have the DOS resources to run it; it requires an emulator like DOSbox to play on modern systems.

                <p>
                    This game is pretty. Seriously, even in an emulator window instead of on the hardware it
                    was specifically envisioned for. I can only imagine how pretty it looked on a 4:3 aspect ratio
                    CRT monitor before I existed. ALSO, the music is phenomenal, done by Johannes Bjerregaard as one of
                    his final video game music compositions in the 90s. It's very clear that a lot of talent went into
                    making this game as good as it is (and play as good as it does!!!) for the time it was in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though I say it "plays good", it has a particular aspect that irks me as someone fluent in the
                    <a title="'What Games Are Like For Someone Who Doesn't Play Games' by Razbuten (YouTube)"
                        href="https://youtu.be/ax7f3JZJHSw">language of video games</a>: Hugo is forced into an
                    animation each time he: touches fruit, or takes any damage, or steps to close to a ledge, or runs
                    too close to a wall... But this issue clearly doesn't stem from lack of creator capability; it stems
                    from the fact that video games as a medium have evolved tremendously in the years between 1995 and
                    now. Trying to play this 1995 DOS game after over a decade of gaming experience in the 2010s was
                    like learning a new language, or perhaps like learning an older dialect of a language in which I am
                    fluent in a newer dialect. I ended up enjoying it, but the steepened learning curve sure did a
                    number
                    on me. The fact that it's hard to begin with is a whole other thing.

                    about its development. In the first one, he said that "the game was a bit too hard for the target
                    audience." ... He was <span class="bi">not</span> kidding. It's like,
                    <i>will-take-you-days-of-dedicated-attempts-to-beat-on-the-easiest-difficulty</i> type of hard.
                    Personally, it took me three days to beat it on easy mode. The fact that completing it at all
                    was a challenge was what made me want to try speedruns of it.

                    It's a short speedrun, being about 10-11 minutes long. It has a few neat tricks and skips, along
                    with a healthy serving of holding the right arrow key, and waiting around for the <i>three minute
                        autoscroller in the middle of the game</i> to pass. But I jest, I actually seriously enjoyed
                    running this game on the side whenever my other speedgames got on my nerves. The amount of skill it
                    requires to complete, along with all of the precise moves and small optimizations within it
                    (including saving time by avoiding all of the forced animations I mentioned earlier), make for a
                    shockingly good speedgame. It has a surprising amount of tech for what it is!

                    If I like it so much, why's it on this list? Well, it sold only about 20,000 copies, exclusively to
                    Scandinavia, almost <i>three decades</i> ago. A community for the game never existed, or had the
                    chance to, and my drive for self competition is only so powerful. However, that would never change
                    the fact that I have the softest spot in the world for this old, forgotten piece of abandonware.
