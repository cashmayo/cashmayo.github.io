            <h1 id="#thestory">Let me tell you a story:</h1>

            <p>
                It was Summer of 2017. I was playing endless amounts of my favorite game that had been released the year
                before: Titanfall 2. I was never too good at games before I picked up Titanfall 2, but <i>something</i>
                about it made me want to work to be the best I could at it. I was watching videos and streams of
                high-skilled players, switching settings for the optimal button layout, spending hours practicing
                mechanics solo in private games, and trying excessively hard in multiplayer matches... y'know:
                everything one would come to expect from a loser who loved video games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then September came around. My mother and brother left for my brother's band camp for a few days just
                before Summer turned into Fall. Obviously, I couldn't be left home alone, so I was sent over to my
                grandmother's house for the duration they were gone. Which might sound unfortunate, but
                fourteen-year-old me didn't care; I was allowed to bring my Xbox! Once I got it all set-up, plugged in,
                and logged into the wifi, I noticed a problem... the internet <span class="bi">sucked.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                I was lucky I could even log into Xbox LIVE with the connection my grandmother had. Playing any online
                matches was out of the question. That left me with offline play... so I booted up the singleplayer, and
                arrived at the start of The Gauntlet. If you don't know, The Gauntlet is a time-trial in the first level
                of Titanfall 2's single-player campaign. It was easily my best option to stay entertained by something
                with even a <i style="font-size:82%;">tiny</i> bit of replay value. It gave me a way to keep practicing
                my movement while I was unable to put my skills to work online.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, away I toiled at this time trial. As my time got lower and lower, I was finding that I was having to
                use increasingly advanced strategies to improve my best time. I remembered seeing my favorite Titanfall
                2 streamer Bryonato (who speedran the game) use frag grenade explosions to boost their velocity through
                the course, so I gave it a try, and developed my own setup to maximize the boost while maintaining an
                optimal route. I had a passing thought along the lines of "Hm, I wonder what's the lowest time anyone's
                ever gotten on this course" but was so absorbed by my improvement that I never bothered to check.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, the three day stay at my grandmother's house had come to an end. I had lowered my personal
                best down to times I didn't know were possible. I packed up my console and controller, and eagerly set
                it back up at home. I happily played away at the multiplayer once again. I was so delighted and eager to
                return to my online grind that I quickly forgot about my time spent in The Gauntlet.
            </p>
            <p>
                But a few months later, after I had gone back to school for my sophomore year, and didn't have nearly as
                much time to play games. A feeling arose that I could only describe as a longing to return to The
                Gauntlet. So, in late November, I once again entered the single-player campaign to be met with the
                familiar sight of The Gauntlet's starting line.
            </p>
            <p>
                After doing a few runs to get back into the groove, I remembered the passing thought I had months prior.
                I went online and looked up the best times for the course. I found a leaderboard with many of the
                fastest times on speedrun.com, and upon reading the top one, I was surprised to find that my time was
                <span class="bi">close.</span> While using my own crude grenade lineups and routes, I had unknowingly
                come within a second of reaching the all-time record.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was then that I realized: I <i>could</i> beat it if I wanted to. I had yet to achieve the best time
                that my strategies would allow; I had only stopped trying because I was no longer at my grandmother's
                house. But now, having the knowledge that the top of that leaderboard was within arm's reach...?
                Something occurred within me. I decided that I <span class="bi">WOULD</span> beat that time top time, no
                matter how long it took me.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a few days of grinding when I got home from school, (responsibly, after all of my work and school
                obligations were taken care of, of course), on the last day of November, I finally did it. I got the
                world's first time below 17 seconds! It was a cool accomplishment for sure, but since I wasn't really in
                any speedrun communities at the time, I had no one to share it with. I was just proud of myself! I
                uploaded the video of the run to YouTube and submitted it to the leaderboard on speedrun.com without
                thinking too much of it. And I went to sleep...
            </p>
            <p>
                I went about the next day like any other Friday: I woke up, went to school, and went back home. It
                wasn't until I got home and started watching Bryonato's stream that I had a sort of wake-up call
                regarding the significance of what I'd done the day prior. I said "hello" in his twitch chat. And to my
                surprise, I immediately received massive congratulations for the run I had posted the night before, from
                not only Bryon, but the rest of his chat as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learned that apparently, because Bryon was a moderator of the speedrun.com leaderboard, he had seen
                that my run was submitted, and he watched it and verified it live on stream! He even recognized my
                username on speedrun.com because I was a frequent chatter in his stream.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hadn't realized until that very moment, but for months, I had been <i>speedrunning.</i> I was a <span
                    class="bi">speedrunner.</span> The feeling of validation, knowing that I wasn't the only one that
                appreciated the effort I put in for that short 17 seconds of gameplay...? It was indescribable. That was
                my introduction to the magic that is being part of a speedrunning community. And I haven't forgotten it
                to this very day.
