        I've realized that everything listed under "Part 1" of the doc is supposed to be on the INDEX page.
        I've done my best work to spread those requirements out across MANY pages. I hope that's acceptable.
        The evidence of my knowledge and effort is here, I promise!!!

            <h1>Hello, World! And Welcome.</h1>
            <p>
                I'm Nick, also known as Cash Mayo, and this is my website! I have some prior experience with HTML and
                CSS from web design classes I took in high school. You may or may not be able to tell that I still have
                a lot to learn! To make this website, I hand wrote it within Visual Studio Code using a few HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript add-ons.
            </p>

            <p>
                I graduated highschool in 2020, and I'm currently taking the online Composition, Networking, Intro to
                Database Systems, and HTML5
                Programming classes at Oakland Community College. You can learn more about my courses <a
                    href="courses.html">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rest of this site will include a bunch of stuff about me, such as things I have done, what I like to
                do, etc. I think the likelihood that you'll find at least half of one of these things interesting is
                pretty good:

                I've done what I can to furnish the place with embeds, and with media that I have rights and permissions
                for. Big thanks to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Staarxzy's Twitter Page"
                    href="https://twitter.com/Staarxzy">@Staarxzy</a> on Twitter for making a ton of the art and doodles
                on this site. Without her work, this site wouldn't be even close to as beautiful as it is!!!!!!
