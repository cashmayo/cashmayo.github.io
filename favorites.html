                <p>
                    I'll start with a bit of an underground pick. (Underground compared to some of the other picks,
                    anyway.) This show focuses on the great-great-great (that's 3 greats) grandchildren of Pongo and
                    Perdita from the original 101 Dalmatians films. It's a cute and artsy addition to the 101D
                    franchise. I say artsy because I think it has an artistic vibe that's stylized but also easy on the
                    eyes. It did a great job of expanding the 101D universe into the modern age and making technology
                    present <i>without</i> forcing it as a centerpiece as a writing crutch (or for the sake of it.) My
                    favorite part of the show is definitely the dynamic between the siblings, especially Dylan and
                    Dolly.

                    101 Dalmatian Street went completely under the radar of most. It got one season that was released in
                    2019, then was canceled. Many believe it was because it had low ratings in the US. Disney really did
                    it dirty by failing to properly promote it. I think it could have been highly beloved had it gotten
                    a proper amount of eyes on it. I myself didn't hear about the show until years after it had ended. I
                    think so much could have been done with the characters and the extension of the 101D world. I'm glad
                    we got what we did though!

                    I can already feel the judgment on this one. I'll tell you what the rest will tell you: No, it's not
                    exclusively for little girls, and yes, it really is enjoyable for anyone open-minded enough to give
                    it a try. The characters are all lovable in their own way. There's a ton of cast diversity
                    (especially in later seasons) so there's bound to be somepony you identify with. The plot of some
                    episodes is kinda mid, but I still have a huge appreciation for the adorable character
                    interactions/development and the writing overall.

                    This is where I <span class="bi">would</span> put a YouTube embed of the MLP:FIM theme. BUT the
                    "Allow embedding" setting for the video/channel has been disabled. Not that you're missing much; the
                    theme song is one of the more divisive topics in the fanbase. I honestly don't mind it, but am
                    willing to admit that without the nostalgia factor it might grate my ears a bit. If you really want,
                    you can listen to the full two minute theme song <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

                <p class="caption">On the bright side, not being able to embed the song gave me a nice segue into

                    I started watching MLP:FiM ten years ago, in 2014. If I cared to, I could try to pull the card that
                    ten years ago, I was younger and closer to the target audience. But I wouldn't be fooling anyone,
                    and like I said at the top of this page, I'm not afraid of the fact that I was (and am) just plain
                    weird. I kept up with the show until it ended in 2019, and I'm still active in the remaining
                    community to this day!

                <p>
                    I can imagine that this one might also elicit some judgment depending on what you've heard. Let me
                    tell you: Bluey is <i>PHENOMENAL.</i> It is one of the most popular shows out there at the moment.
                    It deserves every bit of praise it gets and more. The visuals, writing, and music are spot on. It
                    only gets better as the show goes on. What Ludo Studios can do to make it so engaging with only
                    seven minutes per episode, and no overarching plot, is nothing short of incredible. The show manages
                    to encompass childhood glee and wonder, and still tackle some serious subject matter (and make me
                    shed a tear for a few episodes.) It only gets better and better as you learn more about the world,
                    make new connections, and experience everything alongside the characters.

                    My only regret regarding this show is that it took me so long to give it a shot. I thought after
                    MLP:FiM that there was no way I could become invested in a "kids show" now that I've become an
                    adult, but I was so wrong. It fills my heart with joy to know that a cartoon as good as this one
                    exists in light of the current landscape of media for children. After I got up to date on all of the
                    episodes, I shared the show with my mother, and she also loves it. (If a modern cartoon gets the
                    seal of approval from generation X, you <span class="bi">know</span> it's gotta be good!!!)

                    Now, <i>this</i> franchise I can be almost SURE you haven't heard of, or at least not by this name,
                    (unless
                    you happen to be from Scandinavia.) It's nothing to rave about on the surface; it's a tale of two
                    animals from totally different worlds becoming best friends and going on adventures together. Call
                    me a sucker for enjoying a trope like that, but I do sincerely enjoy the story it tells. The series
                    consists of two traditionally animated films, an MS-DOS game, a TV series, and a third CGI film
                    (that everyone wishes they could forget.)

                <p>
                    On top of my appreciation for the story and history, I regard the media itself as a work of art. The
                    traditional animation is a treat to look at. It's a relic of when animation was beautiful because
                    the human element that went into making it was not only intrinsic to it, but proudly on display as
                    you watched it. I find it a great shame that this franchise, particularly the first two films, never
                    got worldwide fanfare in their heyday. It really could have become a world-renowned franchise, but
                    instead, everywhere outside of Scandinavia only got a poorly localized, cut and diminished release,
                    several years after the original film's debut.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By far the most tragic thing: the original, uncut Danish version of the films and episodes are
                    impossible to find with complete and accurate English subtitles. You'd be hard pressed to find them
                    even if you could be sure they <i>exist.</i> (And you can be sure for the majority of this franchise
                    that they <strong>don't.</strong>) Just another case of lost media, or rather, media that is lost to
                    a lot of the world because it was poorly localized and/or never properly translated. A darn tragedy,
                    to be sure...

                <h2 id="overthehedge">Over the Hedge</h2>
                <p>
                    If you've seen this movie, I think you'll agree that it is a certified 2000's classic. It's got
                    EVERYTHING: the charming CGI animation that was great in its time and still holds up; the comedy,
                    from the simple gags to the running mockery of 21st century consumerism; the bop of a soundtrack
                    with original songs by none other than <i>Ben Folds</i>; the celebrity names cast in voice roles
                    that made you go "Huh? Why would they-?" until you experienced their characters and were like "Oh,
                    yeah. No one else could do a character like that"–
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is nothing else quite like Over the Hedge. It captures the essence of an era so well that
                    despite having zero recollection of watching the film when I was three years old, it made me feel
                    nostalgic the "first" time I watched it in 2020. (Yes: it took me until covid lockdown to take the
                    time to truly experience a masterpiece like Over the Hedge. And no: you don't have to tell me; I
                    know I'm a poser.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was going to embed a trailer from YouTube, but Over the Hedge's time was <i>well</i> before
                    YouTube was the go-to for publishing movie trailers. But I'm sure you know what Over the Hedge is
                    anyways... <span class="bi">right...?</span>
                </p>
                <p>Screw it. Here's a photo of my Over the Hedge media collection:</p>

                <img class="standalone-media" height="405" src="images/othcollection.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    This is the part where I say something about how I wish it had become a franchise, with sequels or a
                    spinoff, and I cry because "celebrity casting killed it" or whatever. And sure, its greatness and
                    success <i>deserved</i> as many expansions as a Dreamworks franchise like Shrek or Kung Fu Panda,
                    or... Madagascar. (LOL... Madagascar.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    But you know what? I think the Over the Hedge "franchise" is perfect as it is. It got a
                    one-of-a-kind movie, and a respectable promotional video game <span class="technically"
                        title="(the game's plot sequentially follows the movie's, but technically the game released BEFORE the movie in most regions, so one could argue that the movie is actually a prequel to the game)">sequel*</span>,
                    (which was a product of the time; releasing a promotional video game alongside a movie was just
                    something you did back then!) It did only what it had to in order to accomplish something great.
                    Thanks to its brevity and restraint, it's gotten away with not only standing the test of time, but
                    doing so as an all-time classic.
